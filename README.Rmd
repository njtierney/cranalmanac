# cranalmanac

The goal of cranalmanac is to provide some interesting datasets from CRAN, on the 
current packages, when they were updated, and when packages were archived.

The name comes from CRAN + Almanac. An Almanac, [according to Wikipedia is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almanac):

> An almanac (also spelled almanack and almanach) is an annual publication that includes information like weather forecasts, farmers' planting dates, tide tables, and other tabular data often arranged according to the calendar. Celestial figures and various statistics are found in almanacs, such as the rising and setting times of the Sun and Moon, dates of eclipses, hours of high and low tides, and religious festivals.

```{r, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/bttf/images/1/13/Almanacfront.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20070110144009")

```

## Example

You can download the data with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
cran_rxiv_pkg_parent_tbl <- cran_rxiv_pkg_parent()

# get 200 packages
cran_rxiv_pkg_child_tbl_200 <- cran_rxiv_pkg_children(cran_rxiv_pkg_parent_tbl,
                                                      n = 200)
```

## Using the data

I've prepared some data to come with the package for the moment, let's look at some example data:

In this example, we are going to look at some of the example data, which 
includes the archived package names

Using this data, we can look at the rate at which CRAN packages are maintained

```{r}
library(cranalmanac)
library(dplyr)

cran_rxiv_pkg_a <-cran_rxiv_pkg_child_tbl_a %>%
  select(-size) %>% 
  mutate(type = "archived") %>%
  bind_rows({
    cran_current_pkg_tbl %>%
      filter(grepl("^A|^a",pkg_name)) %>%
      mutate(type = "cran")
  }) %>%
  arrange(pkg_name, desc(last_modified))

```

```{r}
cran_rxiv_pkg_a
```


```{r}

cran_rxiv_pkg_a %>%
  group_by(pkg_name) %>%
  summarise(n_versions = n(),
            start_date = min(last_modified),
            last_date = max(last_modified),
            reign = last_date - start_date)



cran_rxiv_pkg_a %>%
  group_by(pkg_name) %>%
  summarise(n_versions = n(),
            start_date = min(last_modified),
            last_date = max(last_modified),
            reign = last_date - start_date) %>%
  filter(reign > 365) %>%
  mutate(update_rate = n_versions / as.numeric(reign),
         update_rate = if_else(is.infinite(update_rate),
                               0,
                               update_rate)) %>%
  arrange(desc(update_rate))

```
